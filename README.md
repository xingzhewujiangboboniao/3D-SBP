# 3D-SBP
A Comprehensive buried shipwreck detection method based on 3D SBP data
1. Shipwreck detection based on geometric contour data can be realized by running the Detection.m file
2. .figs show all the extracted voxles and shipwreck model and its corresponding cloud points.
3. Geometric contour extraction code is coming soon.
